#Basics:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main(){
    //!====STD is short for standard, cout is short for character out====
    std::cout << "It's very nice!" << '\n';
    //!====With backlash n you say that you are ending the line there====
    std::cout << "I like milanesa!" << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
